        Having remained off the nomadic radar until very recently, Vietnam has managed to preserve its rather non-touristy character that allows its visitors to stay in a less crowded environment for longer and on a smaller budget.
        
        Another thing that makes Vietnam stand out among its Asian neighbors is its burgeoning coffee culture. Introduced to the country by the French in the 19th century, coffee is now one of Vietnam's main exports and the reason behind the abundance of coffee shops in its large cities. The largest coffeehouse chain in the country is Trung Nguyen, which, with its 5-page coffee drink menu and comfortable low sofas, offers a convenient and inexpensive work environment.',

Since the Coronavirus pandemic, remote work has been valued more than ever, establishing itself as a new work modality throughout the world, even thought in a post-pandemic scenario. Digital nomads are those who make this modality a lifestyle, living and working from anywhere in the world.

Los nómadas digitales tienen muchos lugares en el mundo para elegir, desde ciudades tecnológicas, hasta pueblos medievales y villas con magníficas playas. No obstante, todos estos lugares deben tener algunas características en común. La primera, y más importante, es una buena conexión a internet.

También es importante que haya lugares adecuados para el desarrollo de actividades, como espacios de trabajo compartidos, cafeterías con wifi gratis o lugares donde sea posible organizar eventos y reuniones sociales online.

En tercer lugar, es esencial que el lugar de destinación ofrezca la posibilidad de visado: algunos países permiten solicitar visas de residencia a cambio de inversión. Una de las más populares es la Golden Visa Grecia, puesto que el país heleno cumple con todas las características mencionadas posteriormente.
